# GitMazon

An automated deployment system that allows users to deploy their services with a single click (currently for Java Spring Boot).
----

## Features

- Automated deployment of Spring Boot projects.
- Real-time service interaction via web-based terminal.
- Real-time monitoring of service CPU and RAM usage.

## Technique 
- Employed **Shell Script** to create **Docker images** from user repositories and retrieve real-time servicesâ€™s CPU, RAM usage.
- Deployed user services in **Docker containers** on **AWS EC2**.
- Used **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to route traffic to services.
- Implemented with **Spring Boot** Framework. 
- Utilized **pty4j** with **Xterm.js** to allow users to connect via **SSH** and interact with their services in        real-time through a web-based terminal.
- Employed **shell scripts** to create Docker images from user repositories and retrieve real-time service usage.
- Utilized the **AWS SDK** to dynamically add security group rules, enabling user services to be accessed.
- Received resource usage data via **Kafka** and sends it back to users in real-time through **WebSocket**.
- Implemented a **Webhook** server using **Flask** to trigger deployments when users push new code.

## How to use

1. Log into the system using GitHub OAuth.
2. Fill out a service registration form, including:
    - Selecting a repository to register.
    - Specifying a service name.
    - Defining resource limitations.
3. Monitor service CPU and RAM usage in real-time on the "My Services" page, with an option to connect to the service via SSH.
